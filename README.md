# CEP
(Certificat d Etude Primate) is an attempt of remake of the old "Monkey Academy" distributed by Konami in 1984 on MSX and ColecoVision Platforms.

This is a platform game in which a monkey has to find the right answer to a simple math problem (from primary school)  while jumping on platform and avoiding lethal crabs...

The state:
display of the level
move of the monkey
move of the enemy
low jump is implemented

TODO:
High JMP reaching a upper platform must be completed
Collision detection not yet
Display the math problem
Display score and high score

BUGS:
blinking screen
controls are crappy
Long jump does not work well
fall from a platform did not display an animation
and many more...
